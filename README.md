Why do we need a health insurance you might ask, especially if you're generally healthy. But there are many reasons for having one. First, your health matters the most, and health insurance is a way of helping protect your health. <br>
Here are fews ways health insurances can protect you : -

1. Health insurances are designed to help prepare for unexpected moments in your life, like accidents or illness.
2. Without health insurance, you could be faced with paying medical bills yourself, and health care can be expensive.
3. Health insurance can keep you on track with preventive care â€” which may be covered by insurance at 100%, in many cases. Regular doctor visits may help you stay healthier over time.
